Colorado Box Migration Left &lt; -- > Right

	Selected element in our case div..box on a click event does animate from div..wrap container to div..wrap1 and also reverse. It does animate as the definitions exist inside the particular AnimationLeftRight function and AnimationRightLeft function.
	Function call does trigger the animation process.	  

	Context Switch also debugged so whenever the event empty 'wrap container' occures it does refill it with boxes from parent div#wrap-er and also setup a migration process direction.
